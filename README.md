# Random Songs




### TODO
Cleanup and/or rewrite project without the react template, it includes lots of fluff scsss that I'm not even using anymore.  Made things easier to start with, but harder to maintain.  Also includes lots of vulnerabilities through the frontend dependencies that I'm not concerned with right now
